# CodeFi-Frosh-Workshop

Don't forget to join us Saturday at 12pm to 2PM for a beginner website development tutorial on building your first site using Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is an easy to use frontend web development framework, which allows for responsive and cross platform webpages. We are also going to show how to host it on github with domain and without domain if time permits.
